## FirefoxGithub URL scheme handler

[NOTE]
Google Chrome does not recognize custom URL scheme handler, then we can only use this custom handler in Firefox to jump to chrome.

### Installation

Copy file `./firefox-github.desktop` into `~/.local/share/applications/`

```
$ xdg-mime default firefox-github.desktop x-scheme-handler/firefox-github
$ xdg-mime default firefox-github.desktop x-scheme-handler/firefox-githubs
```

[NOTE]
2 above commands add defaults to `~/.config/mimeapps.list`.
But if it is not detected, try adding the defaults to `~/.local/share/applications/mimeapps.list`

When accessing a URL starts with `firefox-github://` or `firefox-githubs://`, it will launch chrome to open the URL.

Set firefox as default browser.

Install Redirector addon in firefox and import config file `./ubuntu firefox redirector.json`, in which:

* Redirect access to repositories different from Thinkei to chrome.
* Redirect `github-eh` host to `github.com`.
